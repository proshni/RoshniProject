                        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                        <div class="clearfix">
						    <p>It all started on 11/10/2007 when I accompanied my dad to the first fundraising event of my life.  
							   A gentleman called Greg Mortenson was raising funds for his organization” pennies for peace” and had 
							   successfully made schools for girls in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The event was in fancy hotel and I 
							   still remember that the food was amazing. But what was really amazing for me was my dad’s frenzy. 
							   He forced me across a long queue for book signing and seemed overwhelmed with joy as he took pictures 
							   of me with Mr. Mortenson. (picture below).  I was sitting next to him and could not understand why he 
							   constantly nudged me to pay attention to the speeches.  I was getting really bored when the funniest 
							   thing happened. Our table was placed very near the rest area. Mr. Mortenson in between stepped down 
							   from the stage and came towards our table.  My dad bursting with some unfathomable passion, literally 
							   jumped up in front of the surprised Mr. Mortenson, shaking his hand vigorously and sounding cryptic 
							   words of praise. Poor Mr. Mortenson almost tripped and clearly did not know how to deal with my enamored 
							   father.  Finally, Mr. Mortenson made a gesture with his pinky and only then did my embarrassed dad realize 
							   that he was holding Mr. Mortenson from going to the rest room.  Me and my sister stifled our laughter 
							   ducking under the table to avoid being reprimanded.
							</p>
                            <figure class="img-indent2"><img src="images/slide1.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
							<div>
                            <p>Long story short, little did I realize the metamorphosis my father underwent that night. 
							   I did not know till many years later how he did not sleep that entire night.  Himself of humble beginnings, 
							   Education had been the single most powerful factor that transformed his life.  Now Mr. Mortenson had presented 
							   him with an idea that seemed practical and he started dreaming of helping kids in his own village in India.  
							   He went to India to visit his parents every year and gradually started talking to people how such a thing can 
							   be arranged.  Finally, in 2010 he launched the first school in Faridpur village, India. Having not much funds 
							   at that time he bore the cost of the project himself.  With the help of my aunt Fouzia, He hired three teachers, 
							   rented a space, arranged for books, chalked out a curriculum and started his journey. His spirits were high 
							   and I would enjoy listening to him talk with pride about his school. 
							</p>
                            <p>But my father had not accounted for the unpredictability factor.  What he started with a belief in goodness 
							   became a source of ultimate bitterness to him.  Within a year the whole plan collapsed due to the dishonesty 
							   of the people he had hired. The gobbled up his money, sold the school furniture and conned him grandly.  
							   They even stole the money he used to send to provide snacks for kids. When he went to India and tried to 
							   confront them, they openly denied any of his allegations. He came back to US pretty shattered and 
							   defeated.  Looking back, I think he had become depressed. I had never seen this side of my dad and it 
							   scared me to my core and forced me to start thinking how can I improve this process.
							</p>
							<p>That evening, I presented my ideas to my dad in the car ride home.  I gave him the following four-point plan:</p>
							<ul class="list_info">
								<li>My dad, my aunt Fouzia who helps him and all the teachers should be connected via vonage/skype.</li>
								<li>They should form a parent association (like PTA in our schools). The parents should give feedback every 2 weeks via vonage/skype.</li>
								<li>Teachers should take tests weekly and send all the tabulated test results to aunt Fouzia, then only the teachers should be paid.</li>
								<li>To quantify the progress of students, hire an independent teacher to conduct seperate test and report back directly to aunt Fouzia.</li> 
								<li>Hire another reliable person whose job will be to go in person and visit all the center periodically and report back to aunt.</li> 
							</ul>
							<p>What followed after my proposal is impossible to put in writing. My dad had no idea that 
							I was so acutely aware of the difficulties he was facing.  Maybe it was the practical 
							simplicity of my plan, or maybe it was a sense of support he felt from me; whatever the 
							reason my dad snapped out of his melancholy.  And somehow, I grew up in his eyes a little 
							that day. From that day onwards, he actually started working on implementing my plan. 
							His first decision was to choose a better location where he had reliable contacts. 
							Instead of choosing a random village, this time he decided to start in his native village, 
							Gilani. This way he had more reliable people to keep an eye on for him. Next, he hired 
							Azad Uncle to be the manager whose job was to simply monitor the teachers progress and 
							report to him closely.  The teachers were hired after rigorous interviewing and they 
							were told explicitly that part of their job was to send weekly tests to my aunt and in case 
							of negligence, they would lose their job. My aunt keeps a strict eye on the tests and 
							discusses the test performance with the teachers on a weekly basis on skype. In addition, 
							some parents are more than happy to be involved and get together once a month to go over 
							the nuances and requests over skype with my aunt or dad.  The systems with all its checks 
							and balances became very structured and over time we started seeing positive results. 
							Seven years have passed since that eventful car drive.  Seven years of consistent hard work 
							and close monitoring has yielded the rebirth and sustained growth of Roshni project and 
							currently we have total of one hundred and fifty children studying in two different locations.  
							Though we have come a long way in our journey, our efforts continue and we hope to  strengthen 
							our Roshni learning center and empower as many children as possible.</p>
							<p>At the end I would like to say all this planning, fund raising effore would not have 
							made any difference if aunt Fouzia would not have dedicated her life to further this cause, 
							so hats off to her efforts which made roshni project a success.

                	<h2>Testimonials</h2>
					<p class="margin_2">“My association with the Roshni Foundation spans the last 7 years. 
					In this time, I have seen Roshni grow and develop its important and noble mission of bringing the 
					light of education to the children of underprivileged households. Roshni is a very commendable 
					charitable effort, with 100% of donor contributions going towards the educational upliftment of the 
					children and giving them a better chance at progress in their lives. Well done Roshni!!”</p>

					<p class="margin_2">“I believe,education teaches you to think critically in order to 
					differentiate between right and wrong to discover your self worth,to develop your 
					character and to move towards the path of success. The best gift can be given to anyone 
					is education,the ability of reasoning and thinking out of box.  This is exactly what I 
					witnessed through ROSHNI. I have seen the birth of Roshni which emerged from a small 
					village in Bihar, Faridpur, its ups and downs, its struggle for survival to establish 
					its system and eveantully, its success of having shaped the life of so many children. 
					Initially, i was apprehensive and through it was close to impossible to establish this 
					institution. The self belief and gritty determination of Asif, Hemayet and Fouzia in 
					their purpose of spreading education to underprivileged children, finally made me believe 
					in the fact that if one has the will,no task is impossible.Roshni is progressing with 
					leaps and bound in a perfectly organized manner in other villages as well. I feel honoured 
					that I have the blessed opportunity to be a part of such noble cause and to be able to 
					provide small financial aids. I pray that the almighty continues to spread the light of 
					education through ROSHNI.”</p>

					<p class="margin_2">“In today's world, where the majority is obsessed with personal welfare, 
					finding someone making selfless contributions quietly for the welfare of under-priviledged 
					mass is a solace and an assurance that humanity is still thriving on the planet against all 
					odds. *Project Roshni* has been one such great solace. Providing education to those who 
					would never get it otherwise, is actually filling their lives with light which will surely 
					illuminate their path into future. This light will usher brighter dawn for the future 
					generations of these beneficiaries..... and, you know, Roshni is light... ! I have watched 
					the efforts, the contribution and the progress closely. My best wishes for growth of the 
					*Project Roshni.*"</p>

					<p class="margin_2">“I am proud to be associated with the Roshni project, its teachers and 
					its students. The Roshni name says it all as it brings light of education to so many 
					talented and bright children who just need a spark of Roshni to achieve their dreams. 
					Let's keep up the good work for this noble cause."</p>

					<p class="margin_2">“Roshni project is a small education initiative with a huge impact. 
					Roshni educates girls in a part of the world where girls are supposed to stay home and do 
					domestic work. Providing this opportunity to the girls makes an enormous impact in the 
					girls lives giving them hope and vision along with quality education. I hope these girls 
					will become leaders in their communities carry this flag forward ultimately making a big 
					impact in the world. I sincerely congratulate everyone involved and supporting this 
					inspiring and courageous project."</p>
